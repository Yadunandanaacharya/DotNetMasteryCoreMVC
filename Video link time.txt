#. connection string
*. in sql server if you use . or localhost it won't connect it gives error 
so use: server name as: localhost\SQLEXPRESS

In localhost\SQLEXPRESS  here SQLEXPRESS name you have to add or not based on
seeing in 'services.msc' there SQL SERVER(either sqlexpress or mysqldb) 
based on what we installed it comes in services.msc


#. save .cshtml in visual studio to appear content in browser what to do?
first run visual studio
next go back visual studio when app runs in browser
now in visual studio you'll see "Continue" button right side to that you see 
fire icon with dropdown arrow click on it

next select option "hot reload on file save"
with this if you do any changes in cshtml file then save it refreshed browser
we don't have close browser and re run visual studio

#. used toaster for notification disapper after 3seconds
